# weatherTilesToGoogleDrive
This Python 2.7 script does: 
  1. Authtenticate to Google Drive using a private-creditials.json file.
  2. If private-creditials.json does not exist or has expired, a web page will appear so user can allow 'progrom' to authtinticate to Google Drive. This will use a client_secrets.json file that is download from Google Developer. 
  3. Updating existing files on Google Drive in a given Google Drive directory. Note that this only update the files right now. Function does exist to create files but no implemented. 
  4. Will also create weather images that is used in Action Tile layout for personal use. 
  
  This is used for personal use and was put together fron a lot of searching on the Internet. Sharing this code hoping that someone will find useful.
